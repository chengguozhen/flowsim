## Getting Started
Flowsim is always looking for active contributors who are interested 
in SDN or web development. Flowsim contributors meet daily, through 
google hangouts, to discuss active development tasks. If you would 
like to contribute you should join our mailing list, introduce yourself,
and ask questions.
