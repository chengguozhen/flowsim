\section{Parametric Pipeline}

A pipeline is a collection of stages and control flow edges. Each stage can be
thought of as a function that operates over one or more inputs and returns an 
output. The datatype that flows between stages is called the Context.

A pipeline computes
by moving a generic data structure, called the Context, between 

The pipeline is composed of seven stages: Arrival, Extraction, Choice, 
Selection, Execution, Group, and Egress. Stages are connected together to
form a directed graph
