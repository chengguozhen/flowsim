OpenFlow provides a rich and powerful set of packet processing 
primitives that can drastically transform the landscape of network service and 
application development. However, OpenFlow is also a complicated set of 
specifications and can initially appear inaccessible non-experts. 
Furthermore, the existing tools to experiment and debug OpenFlow programs are 
largely limited in feature  support, and provide limited visibility into the
internals of the OpenFlow  packet processing machine.

FlowSim is an experimentation and visual debugging tool that models a
parametric packet processing pipeline that can reduce to any existing valid 
OpenFlow pipeline organization. Additionally, we present a model and visual 
representation of trace execution. Arbitrary protocol field matching and 
modification is supported and invalid pipeline configurations are prohibited 
through a system of types and constraints.
