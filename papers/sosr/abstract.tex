OpenFlow provides an incredibly rich and powerful set of packet processing 
primitives that can drastically transform the process of network service and 
application development. However, OpenFlow is also a complicated set of 
specifications and can appear inaccessible to most upon initial exposure. First,
the OpenFlow abstractions have highly complex and interdependent behaviors which
are not easy to understand. Second, there are many versions and varying
implementations of the protocol. Combined, these present a high barrier to entry
to all non-experts. Further, those who overcome the obstacles to familiarize
themselves with OpenFlow face yet another set of challenges; the existing tools
to experiment and debug OpenFlow programs are largely limited in feature 
support, and provide limited visibility into the internals of the OpenFlow 
packet processing machine.

FlowSim is an experimentation and visual debugging tool that models the OpenFlow
packet processing machine. This paper contributes a model for a parametric
packet processing pipeline that can reduce to any existing valid OpenFlow 
pipeline organization. Additionally, we present a model and visual 
representation of trace execution. Arbitrary protocol field matching and 
modification is supported and invalid pipeline configurations are prohibited 
through a system of types and constraints.
