OpenFlow provides an incredibly rich and power set of packet processing 
primitives that have the potential to drastically change the process of 
network service and application development. However, the OpenFlow 
specification is an extremely complicated beast. First, OpenFlow is an 
incredibly rich set of networking abstractions that have highly complex
and interdependent behaviors which is not always easy to understand. Second,
there are many versions of the protocol in terms of standard specifications
and switch implementations. This presents a high degree of variability and is
difficult to understand by all but the expert engineer. Finally, the existing
tools to experiment and debug OpenFlow programs are largely limited in feature
support, and provide limited visibility into the internals of the OpenFlow
packet processing abstraction.
