------
There has been work [x,y,z] regarding network simulators, but this prior work focuses on observing packets at the topology level. Network simulators x, y, z visualize the forwarding path of a packet as it traverses a network topology. Visualzing a packet that is forwarded out the wrong port of a router, an observer could infer an incorrect routing table. As traditional network devices are replaced by programmable dataplanes, packet path visualizations at the topology level become less helpful.

Level of observation
---------------------
The ability to observe the functionality of a programmable dataplane is 
critical to ensuring the correctness of a sdn application. 
Recent tools [x, y, z] give users the ability to observe software defined
networks, but only at the topology level....  

[x, y, z] utilize linux containers to emulate multiple network 
nodes on a single host. Linux namespace provides os level virtualization 
of resources such as CPU, I/O, Network stacks, etc. Because each node is 
just a virtualized OS users are able to experiment with real 
implementations of network stacks, dataplanes, and controllers. While 
the ability to bring any software implementation is great... not all
programmable dataplanes are implemented in software... 
The most common software dataplane used is OpenVSwitch. 
OpenVSwitch does not support enabling and disabling of dataplane capabilities.
There is not a tool for simulating dataplanes with varying capabilities.

Mininet eliminates the burden of dealing with network namespaces 
by providing an API for orchestrating the configuration of a topology, and 
modeling their namespace configuration in terms of network elements (hosts, 
switches, links, controllers). 

Sim tools today:
 - observes packets at the topology level 
 - Estinet
   - focused on link simulation (latency, bandwidth)
   - stepped by time packet arrival/leave from node
   - bring your own network stack 
 - Mininet
   - Emulator
   - bring your own network stack 
 - onf/AIR?
Flowsim:
 - observe packets at the dataplane level
